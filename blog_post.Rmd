# Challenge

'Hanukkah of Data' is a [data
challenge](https://hanukkah.bluebird.sh/about/) where you have to solve
8 puzzles surrounding a fictional dataset.

We are asked to find a rug for our granduncle Noah who owns a store. The
store has data about customer, products and orders. With the help of the
data ([CSV
files](https://github.com/duju211/hanukkah_of_data/tree/master/csv)) we
are asked to solve a total of eight puzzles.

# Data

The data for this analysis consists of four CSV files:
`r tar_read(txt_csv)`. The data is read into R with the help of the
`readr::read_csv` function, specifying the correct column types as
arguments in the function calls.

## Customers

There are a total of `r nrow(df_customers_raw)` customers in the raw
data. Perform the following preprocessing steps:

-   Determine the Initials by splitting the name into first and last
    name
-   Extract all digits from the phone number and save in column
    `phone_chr`
-   Remove duplicates

```{embed}
"R/customers.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_customers
```

## Products

There are a total of `r nrow(tar_read(df_products))` products. Perform
the following preprocessing:

-   Extract the category by removing all digits from the `desc` string

-   Extract additional information that can be found in the bracket text

-   Remove remaining brackets from `add_info` and `desc`

```{embed}
"R/products.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_products)
```

## Orders

```{embed}
"R/orders.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_orders)
```

# Puzzles

## Puzzle 1

To find the rug, we will need to contact a private investigator. The
last name of the investigator can be spelled by using the letters
printed on the phone buttons. For example: 2 has "ABC", and 3 "DEF",
etc.

The key pad of the phone can be represented in R like this:

```{embed}
"R/phone_letter.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_phone_letter)
```

By combining this representation with the data on hand, we can determine
the investigator:

```{embed}
"R/investigator.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_investigator) |>
  select(customerid, name, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```

## Puzzle 2

Now we are looking for a contractor, to whom the rug was given to by a
cleaning company. The following is known:

-   The contractor has the initials 'jd'
-   The cleaning company and the contractor had meetings at Noah's over
    coffee and bagels
-   The cleaning company stopped outsourcing a few years ago

```{embed}
"R/contractor.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_contractor) |>
  select(customerid, name, citystatezip, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```

## Puzzle 3

We are searching for the neighbor of the contractor. The neighbor has
the following characteristics:

-   Star Sign: Aries
    -   March 21 - April 19
-   Born in the year of the Dog
    -   Every 12 years (2018 for example)
-   Lives in the neighborhood

Dog years are determined by the following function:

```{embed}
"R/det_dog_years.R"
```

Resulting in: `r str_flatten(tar_read(dog_years), ', ')`

With this information we can find out who the neighbor is:

```{embed}
"R/spider_hat.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_spider_hat) |>
  select(customerid, name, citystatezip, birthdate, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```

## Puzzle 4

The next persons has the following habit:

-   Claims the first pastries of the day

Filter products for the '`r tar_read(product_pastries)`' category and
search for the person which always orders these products first:

```{embed}
"R/tinder_woman.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_tinder_woman) |>
  select(customerid, name, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```

## Puzzle 5

In the 5th puzzle we need to find a lady with a lot of cats as pets. We
know about her and her pets:

-   The cats are senior

-   She lives in Queens

-   She has a lot of cats

```{embed}
"R/cat_lady.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_cat_lady) |>
  select(customerid, name, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```

## Puzzle 6

The cat lady has a very frugal cousin. She tells us: *"
Noah [...] loses money whenever she comes in the store":*

```{embed}
"R/frugal_cousin.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_frugal_cousin) |>
  select(customerid, name, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```

## Puzzle 7

The frugal cousin tells us how she met her ex-boyfriend.
They met while they were buying the same product, but in different
colors. So we look at all the orders from the frugal cousin and search
for that incident:

```{embed}
"R/ex_boyfriend.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_ex_boyfriend) |>
  select(customerid, name, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```

## Puzzle 8

Finally, we search for a collector. The collector is in possession of a
complete set of
Noah\'s collectibles. By looking at the data, the relevant category is
'`r tar_read(product_collect)`':

```{embed}
"R/collector.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_collector) |>
  select(customerid, name, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```

# End

Participation in the 'Hanukkah of Data' competition was a challenging
and rewarding experience. It was a great chance to show and improve my
problem solving + coding capabilities and I'm already looking forward to
next year!
