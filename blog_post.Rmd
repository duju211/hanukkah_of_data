# Challenge

'Hanukkah of Data' is a [data challenge](https://hanukkah.bluebird.sh/about/)
where you have to solve 8 puzzles surrounding a fictional data set.

To solve the puzzles we use the following R libraries:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Day 1

To find the rug, we will need to contact a private investigator.
The last name of the investigator can be spelled by using the letters printed
on the phone buttons. For example: 2 has “ABC”, and 3 “DEF”, etc.

The key pad can be represented in R like this:

```{r, file="R/phone_letter.R"}
```

We then need to find the last name of each person. Transform the data so that
every letter is one row:

```{r, file="R/last_names.R"}
```

By combining both data sources, we can answer the question:

```{r, file="R/investigator.R"}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_customers) |>
  semi_join(tar_read(df_investigator), by = "customerid") |>
  select(customerid, name, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```
