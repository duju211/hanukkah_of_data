# Challenge

'Hanukkah of Data' is a [data challenge](https://hanukkah.bluebird.sh/about/)
where you have to solve 8 puzzles surrounding a fictional dataset.

We are asked to find a rug for our granduncle Noah who owns a store. The
store has data about customer, products and orders. With the help of the data
([CSV files](https://github.com/duju211/hanukkah_of_data/tree/master/csv))
we are asked to solve a total of eight puzzles.

# Data

The data for this analysis consists of four CSV files: `r tar_read(txt_csv)`.
The data is read
into R with the help of the `readr::read_csv` function,
specifying the correct column types as arguments in the function calls.

## Customers

There are a total of `r nrow(df_customers_raw)` customers in the raw data.
Perform the following preprocessing steps:

* Determine the Initials by splitting the name into first and last name
* Extract all digits from the phone number and save in column `phone_chr`
* Remove duplicates

```{embed}
"R/customers.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_customers
```

## Products

```{embed}
"R/products.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_products)
```

## Orders

```{embed}
"R/orders.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_orders)
```

# Puzzles

## Puzzle 1

To find the rug, we will need to contact a private investigator.
The last name of the investigator can be spelled by using the letters printed on the
phone buttons. For example: 2 has “ABC”, and 3 “DEF”, etc.

The key pad of the phone can be represented in R like this:

```{embed}
"R/phone_letter.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_phone_letter)
```

By combining this representation with the data on hand, we can determine the
investigator:

```{embed}
"R/investigator.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_investigator) |>
  select(customerid, name, phone) |>
  gt()
```

## Puzzle 2

Now we are looking for a contractor, to whom the rug was given to by a 
cleaning company. The following is known:
 
* The contractor has the initials 'jd'
* The cleaning company and the contractor had meetings at Noah's over coffee
and bagels
* The cleaning company stopped outsourcing a few years ago

```{embed}
"R/contractor.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_contractor) |>
  select(customerid, name, citystatezip, phone) |>
  gt()
```

## Puzzle 3

We are searching for the neighbor of the contractor. The neighbor has the
following characteristics:

* Star Sign: Aries
  * March 21 - April 19
* Born in the year of the Dog
  * Every 12 years (2018 for example)
* Lives in the neighborhood

Dog years are determined by the following function:

```{embed}
"R/det_dog_years.R"
```

Resulting in:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(dog_years)
```

With this information, filter for the neighbor:

```{embed}
"R/spider_hat.R"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_spider_hat) |>
  select(customerid, name, citystatezip, birthdate, phone) |>
  gt()
```
