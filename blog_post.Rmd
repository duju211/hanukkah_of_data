# Challenge

'Hanukkah of Data' is a [data challenge](https://hanukkah.bluebird.sh/about/)
where you have to solve 8 puzzles surrounding a fictional data set.

To solve the puzzles we use the following R libraries:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Day 1

To find the rug, we will need to contact a private investigator.
The last name of the investigator can be spelled by using the letters printed
on the phone buttons. For example: 2 has “ABC”, and 3 “DEF”, etc.

The key pad can be represented in R like this:

```{r, file="R/phone_letter.R"}
```

We then need to find the last name of each person. Transform the data so that
every letter is one row:

```{r, file="R/last_names.R"}
```

By combining both data sources, we can answer the question:

```{r, file="R/investigator.R"}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_customers) |>
  semi_join(tar_read(df_investigator), by = "customerid") |>
  select(customerid, name, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```

## Day 2

Now we are looking for a contractor, to whom the rug was given to by a
cleaning company.

Look for customers with the searched initials:

```{r, file="R/initials.R"}
```

We then look for products that are 'coffee' or 'bagels'.
Join the order items to the filtered products:

```{r, file="R/coffee_bagels.R"}
```

Look for 2017 orders where coffee or bagels were bought.
Keep only those were the customer has the above mentioned initials.

```{r, file="R/order_contractor.R"}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_customers) |>
  semi_join(tar_read(df_order_contractor), by = "customerid") |>
  select(customerid, name, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```

## Day 3

Search for the neighbor with the spider hat.

Define rabbit years (pasted from wikipedia):

```{r, file="R/rabbit_years.R"}
```

Filter for

* Born in dog year
* Born in cancer zodiac
* Lives in neighborhood to contractor

```{r, file="R/spider_hat.R"}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_spider_hat) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```

## Day 4

Look for order items that are 'pastries':

```{r, file="R/order_items_pastries.R"}
```

Look for persons that order pastries early in the morning:

```{r, file="R/tinder_woman.R"}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_tinder_woman) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```


## Day 5

Look for people that live in Staten Island:

```{r, file="R/staten_island.R"}
```

Look for products that represent cat food for senior cats:

```{r, file="R/senior_cat_food.R"}
```

Combine the information and look for the searched woman:

```{r, file = "R/cat_lady.R"}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_customers) |>
  semi_join(tar_read(df_cat_lady), by = join_by(customerid)) |>
  select(customerid, name, citystatezip, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```

## Day 6

Calculate margin for each order item

```{r, file="R/order_items_margins.R"}
```

Determine customer with the lowest total margin:

```{r, file="R/frugal_cousin.R"}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_customers) |>
  semi_join(tar_read(df_frugal_cousin), by = join_by(customerid)) |>
  select(customerid, name, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```


## Day 7

Find all orders that contain a colored item:

```{r, file="R/color_orders.R"}
```

Search for orders that happened in close proximity to the orders of the
frugal cousin:

```{r, file="R/ex_boyfriend.R"}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_customers) |>
  semi_join(tar_read(df_ex_boyfriend), by = join_by(customerid)) |>
  select(customerid, name, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```

# Day 8

Look for products that are collectibles

```{r, file="R/collectibles.R"}
```

Find the person

```{r, file="R/collector.R"}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_customers) |>
  semi_join(tar_read(df_collector), by = join_by(customerid)) |>
  select(customerid, name, phone) |>
  gt() |>
  as_raw_html()
```
